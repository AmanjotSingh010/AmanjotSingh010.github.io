<h1>Jasmine</h1>

<p>
Loving you was never a decision.  
It happened quietly…  
and then all at once.
</p>

<p>
You became my calm in chaos,  
my strength on weak days,  
my home without walls.
</p>

<p>
After living with you, you made me feel what love is.  
I like when I go with you out and people recognise us as one 
This gave me a big smile in my heart.
Listen I know I hurt you a lot of time and being dishonest too.
I have a feeling and I want to share with you that we can make it.  
I know People will talk. Families will question.  
But if the world stands on one side and you stand on the other,  
I want to be on the side you are cause you can make my thing possible.
But it will be hard and I know we have to go through thing and I know 
You don't have time and energy as you have already gone through a lot already 
And I want that you to be respected and care and also its your time to get bit soiled too
I am also willing to face things for you to stand with you, I have a feeling that in the end you will worth for me.
And I know that I do bullshit things and I know I deserve to be curse, and I am not good and you have rights to hate me 
I have told you lies but from the full honesty and truth is I really love you and wanted to you to be happy and want the best for you
I wanted to ask are you willing to be with me. 
</p>

I don’t promise perfection.  
I promise presence.  
Choosing you, every single day.
